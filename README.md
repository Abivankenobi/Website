# Books Selling Web Page

##### Disclaimer: I am primarily a backend developer, so assume that this project is shit. If you feel you can help me with css, push requests, or text me on WhatsApp(number on the page) or DM me on Instagram (abhinav_sharma2k05).

### This is a static web-page, trying to sell my first year books to upcoming first-yearites at *BITS-PIlani, Pilani Campus*, nothing much serious.
### If you want a page like this of your own, feel free to fork, add your own number in place of mine, and you are good to go.

**Also, I have added some assets for web-pages, you can change the background using those pages by choosing the name of you desired background pic in style.css -> body -> background-image: URL(your-desired-file-name).**

Most of this is just filters on the original, you may use canva for goated filers.
